# Recursion Lab

## Introduction
In this lab, you will investigate recursive techniques in programming. Some problems lend themselves to recursive solutions, and some do not. In this lab, we will take a look at some fundamental examples of recursive problems starting with the most simple (the factorial) and building to more complex problems.

## Programs

This lab includes the following programs:

1. factorial.py
2. fibonacci.py
3. hanoi.py

For each of the programs, read the documentation and write the code as described.
